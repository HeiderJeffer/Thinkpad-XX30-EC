This directory contains a couple of experiments aimed at making a simpler
patch experience.

One option is to use "nasm" and have the relevant structures that need
patching all expanded as 'easier' to edit assembly declarations.

This should allow a path to making the patches on Windows (nasm is easily
available for Windows).  The assembly code would serve as a better
documentation for the structures that are being edited.  This, in turn,
would allow more people to try to change things.

Part of this work is a tool to automatically dump the structures from a
binary firmware.  Currently, this just outputs a graphviz chart showing
the relationships, in the future it could output a template nasm file.
